// Problem.
// Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome, otherwise false.
// Rules
// JavaScript doesn't have this datatype but we can imitate it with a simple object with each next list member being nested in the previous object.
// The first and outermost object is the head.
// Each item should have 2 attributes, data and next.
// There is no permutation, so we determine palindromocity with the list as is..

// Use cases / Theorems

// Solution 1:

// Tests 1: Iterative





// Performance


// What I learned


// Notes
