# Build a String Based on 2 Other Strings

**Problem**

Given two strings, build a new string that takes one character at a time from the first string and two characters at a time from the second string.

**Example:**

```
let s1 = 'abcd', s2 = '12345678';
// Resulting string: a12b34c56d78
```

## Notes

This is one I was actually asked. It is a very simple, straightforward question but I struggled with it for a few reasons.
- One, the interviewers did a shit job of explaining it. One of them wasn't there in the beginning and showed up halfway through the explanation.
- Two, there were no example strings.
- Three, I had just come straight from my current job and it was hot as hell and I had just finished some real programming and I was very much in that mindset still, asking things like do I need to validate the string lengths because I was not in the mood for theoretical scenarios even though it was an interview. Obviously it would have been better to make time to get in the right mood but that wasn't possible.
- They were backend developers and I don't think they appreciate the wide variety of string manipulation possibilities in the very gender fluid JavaScript. I also don't always remember syntax that well so I can get a little lost on substr vs. substring vs. treating a string as an array vs. slice vs. charAt vs. which one is which and oh yeah which one would actually perform better in this situation. Maybe I tend to overthink it in interviews. That's on me. This is Four, by the way.
