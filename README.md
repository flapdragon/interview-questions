## Some Unsolicited Advice :pray: :brain:
Before you begin, please allow me to make a humble request. Don't look at the solution. Try to solve it yourself first. Don't even look up the concept of the solution or the how to. Don't open a new tab. Open up that terminal and fire up your own local server. Try to figure out the entire thing yourself. It will make you a better programmer and a better thinker. It will take longer, and your first solution might not be the best, especially for concepts that might be new to you, but that's OK. In fact it's more than OK it's awesome because now you are becoming familiar with a new concept.

All I'm saying is, it's so easy these days to find quick answers to any question and when we are facing a deadline or some other pressure it's too tempting to not put any thought into solving it ourselves. I'm just asking that you remember to take care of your brain, and let it grow, and not just take care of the sprint tasks or the corporation.


## Famous Problems
These are the famous programming problems. You don't get them asked in JavaScript interviews too much or ever. Honestly in JS interviews it's mostly string manipulation questions which I think is a trash type of question. Nevertheless I am solving these famous ones in JavaScript.
|Problem|Solution|
|---|---|
|[Two Sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem)|[Solutions](two-sum)|
|[Rotate Matrix](http://theoryofprogramming.com/2017/12/31/rotate-matrix-clockwise/)|[Solutions](rotate-matrix)|
|[Zero Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/)|[Solutions](zero-matrix)|
|[Fibonacci Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)|[Solutions](fibonacci-series)|


## Concepts
These are concepts I believe every developer should be familiar with. I have asked other developers to explain their understanding of these concepts in interviews I have given and I myself have been asked about some of them in my own interviews. They are fundamental and common concepts that any developer will encounter as well as specific ones junior developers have asked me about.
