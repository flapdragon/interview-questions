# Palindrome Permutation

Given a string consisting of lowercase letters, figure out whether any permutation of this string is a palindrome.

 - Input must be a string consisting of only lowercase letters. I am treating case is irrelevant and toLowerCasing everything.
 - Output should be true/false, but it is cool to see the palindrome(s).
 - Note: neither the string nor the palindrome have to be a word. At first I was thinking of normal palindromes but for this exercise it can be any random string of letters.

**Basic Examples:**
```
Input: abc
Output: false

Input:  aab
Output: true (aba)

Input:  abcdef
Output: false
```
