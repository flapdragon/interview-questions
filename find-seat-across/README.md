# Find the Seat Across from Seat X

**Problem**
There is a plane with seats that are arranged in groups of 12.
The groups of 12 seats are split into 2 rows of 6 that are facing each other, with some space for the center walkway down the middle.
That's weird right? Is this some sort of billionaire sex tourism plane?
Assuming we can find a dry seat, write a function that will, given a number X, find the seat across from the given seat that faces it: f(x) = a.

**Example:**
<pre>
  1  2  3     4  5  6
  7  8  9    10 11 12
</pre>

Find the seat across from seat 4.
```
f(4) = 10
```
